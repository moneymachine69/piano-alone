// To rotate your dot skeleton around a central point by a random angle, you'll need to apply a rotation transformation to each of your keypoints. This involves a bit of trigonometry, specifically using sine and cosine functions to calculate the new positions of your keypoints after rotation. The process is as follows:

// Choose a pivot point for rotation: This is the point around which your skeleton will rotate. Since you want to rotate the entire skeleton, the most logical pivot point would be the location where the user clicks, which you've referred to as the center location of the dot skeleton.

// Calculate the rotation for each keypoint: To rotate a point (x, y) around a pivot point (px, py) by an angle θ (in radians), you can use the following equations to find the new position (x', y'):

// scss
// Copy code
// x' = cos(θ) * (x - px) - sin(θ) * (y - py) + px
// y' = sin(θ) * (x - px) + cos(θ) * (y - py) + py
// These equations rotate the point (x, y) around the point (px, py) by the angle θ.

// Apply the rotation to all keypoints: Use the above transformation for each of your keypoints, with the pivot point being the this.location (where the user clicks) and θ being the random angle you wish to rotate by.

// Here's how you might integrate this into your code. Assuming you've already generated a random angle randomAngle in radians:

// javascript
// Copy code
// function rotatePoint(x, y, px, py, theta) {
//     var cosTheta = cos(theta);
//     var sinTheta = sin(theta);
    
//     var newX = cosTheta * (x - px) - sinTheta * (y - py) + px;
//     var newY = sinTheta * (x - px) + cosTheta * (y - py) + py;
    
//     return createVector(newX, newY);
// }

// // Assuming `this.location` is your pivot point and `randomAngle` is the angle in radians
// this.head = rotatePoint(this.head.x, this.head.y, this.location.x, this.location.y, randomAngle);
// // Repeat the above line for all keypoints
// You'd repeat the rotatePoint call for each keypoint, substituting this.head.x, this.head.y with the x and y coordinates of the keypoint you're rotating. This process rotates each keypoint around the this.location by randomAngle, effectively rotating the entire skeleton.

// Note: Ensure that you calculate the original positions of your keypoints (as you're doing now) before applying the rotation. This ensures that the skeleton is first assembled in its upright position and then rotated as a whole.
